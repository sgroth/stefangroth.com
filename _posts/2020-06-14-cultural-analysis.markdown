## 1. Stefan Groth: Introduction: Comparison as Social and Cultural Practice[^2] <a href="{{ entry.pdf | file_url }}" class="pdf-l">PDF</a>

## 2. Helena Petterson, Katarzyna Wolanik Boström, Magnus Öhlander: Resistance or Thuggery? Political Narratives of Urban Riots <a href="{{ entry.pdf | file_url }}" class="pdf-l">PDF</a>
> Comparison is a way to make sense of reality, e.g. by contrasting places, “cultures” or practices (Wolanik Boström & Öhlander 2015:7). It may present different degrees of something, or create a dichotomy, and imply a hierarchy of values. The article analyzes how comparison as a tool is used by highly skilled Swedish professionals when they tell about participating in international work mobility and their subsequent return to Sweden. Empirically the analysis is based on 46 interviews with Swedish medical professionals and 30 interviews with scholars in Swedish Humanities.

## 3. Pihla Maria Siim: Comparison as a Means of Encountering Others in the Estonian–Finnish Transnational Space <a href="{{ entry.pdf | file_url }}" class="pdf-l">PDF</a>
> Drawing on interviews with Estonian families who move between Estonia and Finland, the article elaborates on how interviewees use comparison to build their identity and belonging and to justify their choices. When negotiating membership in Finland, the strategy of invisibility is available since there are no visible differences that would cause them to be categorised as different. However, Estonian families also use contrast as a form of counter-speech against discrimination and as a strategy to highlight the difference between themselves and different others, portraying themselves as hard-working, deserving immigrants.

## 4. Valeska Flor: Between Madness and Reason: Comparison, Climate Change and Intergenerational Negotiations of Guilt <a href="{{ entry.pdf | file_url }}" class="pdf-l">PDF</a>
> Climate change has become one of the most pressing issues of our time. It is firmly anchored in the Anthropocene and it can be defined as an environmental, cultural and political phenomenon that is reshaping the global world. This paper analyses how comparisons are used in the climate change debate as a way to negotiate norms and values, to regulate responsibilities and clarify questions of certain forms of contested agency as a narrative attribution of guilt and blame, especially with regard to the moral discourse on options for action, as well as to draw up possible courses of action for a climate-friendly future. An ethnographic example of an exaggerated depiction of generational conflict is used to show the extent to which opposites but also similarities are created through the process of comparison. In addition to the extent to which plausibility and credibility and guilt, blame and justice are negotiated, it is emphasized that the dichotomous use of generational comparison refers less to a binary understanding of generational justice and capacity to act, but must rather be evaluated as a narrative code in the communication and meeting process.

## 5. Stefan Groth: Comparison as Reflective and Affective Practice: Orientations Towards the Middle in Recreational Road Cycling[^3] <a href="{{ entry.pdf | file_url }}" class="pdf-l">PDF</a>
> The paper discusses comparisons in recreational road cycling and asks how hobby athletes compare themselves and their performances with others. Based on a research project on orientations towards the middle, the paper shows how criteria of comparison are dynamic and negotiated in relation to other athletes as well as to a range of different motives. It shows how comparisons entail reflective, anticipatory and affective elements and how available data and subjective estimations about the performance of others influence comparative constellations.
