CfP: Temporality

This special issue examines the relationship between talk and temporality. Speakers mobilize different temporal levels; they explicitly or implicitly reflect on time through linguistic references, and use temporality as a linguistic resource through a variety of linguistic forms. In various fields, forms of and approaches to linguistically mediated time have been variously thematized: as spatially bounded time through deictics of there and then and here and now, as spatially unbound duration and timelessness, as biographical time in narrative processes, as narrative structure, and as the 'real timeâ€› of linguistic interaction processes. The editors invite articles that examine the semiotics of talk and time from different methodological and disciplinary approaches. Some questions to consider include: 

* how temporality narratively generates legitimacy 
* how temporality is used as a resource for interaction
* how different temporalities are linguistically mediated
* which temporal levels are inherent in linguistic action of social * positioning
* how social positioning is perceived as temporalized

Guest editors Anna Weichselbraun and Stefan Groth invite essays, articles, and book reviews for this special issue on the semiotics of time and talk. There is no final deadline as we will continue publishing new contributions in an ongoing dialog.
